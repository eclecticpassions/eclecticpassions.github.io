</a>Retiring my trusty daily driver</div></h2><p>My digital life, since 2012, has been lived through the Apple MacBook Air mid-2012 13", maxed out spec (Dual-Core Intel Core i7 2Ghz, 8GB DDR3 RAM, 512GB SATA SSD). It has served me very well over the years, but increasingly more apps are dropping their software support for Catalina, like Adobe Lightroom Classic - an essential app for me.</p><p>I also had the internal SSD fail on me last year. Luckily a full format, fsck and clean OS install to Catalina saved it; albeit temporarily. Since then, I&rsquo;ve been on the lookout for a replacement - to which I chose the Mac Mini M1, acting as a stopgap upgrade before investing in a MacBook Pro 14" or 16" with the rumoured impressive 3nm Apple Silicon chip.</p><img src=/2023/sudden-influx-of-new-gear/ssd_health.webp alt="Smartctl results of the 2012 MacBook Air"><p>Fast forward to last week, I found an almost like new (SSD lifespan only about 1TB data written, less than 30 hours power on hours) Mac Mini M1 in the configuration I want, 16GB RAM + 1TB SSD, for ~$570USD / $540EUR. I pounced at the deal - it even had Apple Care till February of next year!</p><h2 id=apple-m1-misery><div><a href=#apple-m1-misery>#
</a>Apple M1 misery?</div></h2><p>I always had a smooth experience with macOS El Capitan and Mojave on my Air. Even during the bigger jump to Catalina, most software ran well with no crashes or major issues. All the apps I want to run works well. Unfortunately, I cannot say the same for the M1 Mac Mini running Ventura 13.6.</p><p>Ventura OS itself was fairly buggy. Even when moving around Finder and System Settings, I found little bugs here and there. These were some of the things that didn&rsquo;t work for me:</p><ul><li>Pointer often changes to an &ldquo;adjust width&rdquo; icon even when I&rsquo;m no where near the edge of a window</li><li>The window asking for my password doesn&rsquo;t pop to the front of the Settings window when I change a setting, making it appear as if Settings is not responding</li><li>Universal Control is not straight forward to setup</li><li>USB-A ports on the back loses power/connectivity after sleeping occasionally (Reports of it <a href="https://discussions.apple.com/thread/253514345?answerId=256577222022#256577222022">here</a> and <a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/mac-mini-m1-usb-ports-not-working-after-wake-from-sleep.2326616/?post=32549313#post-32549313">here</a>)</li><li>Often unable to eject external drives and have to resort to logging out or restarting, even with spotlight indexing turned of for said drive</li><li>Not entering sleep mode normally, constantly has wakeup power events scheduled automatically and repeatedly, which I am guessing is related to the loss of power in the USB-A ports. (Reports of it <a href="https://discussions.apple.com/thread/254333766?page=4">here</a> and <a href=https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/macos-ventura-13-1-power-events-cause-wakeup-from-sleep.2373692/>here</a>)</li></ul><h3 id=hardware-fail-there-may-be-an-issue-with-a-memory-module><div><a href=#hardware-fail-there-may-be-an-issue-with-a-memory-module>##
</a>Hardware fail: &ldquo;There may be an issue with a memory module.&rdquo;</div></h3><p>After about two days of setting up and manually migrating files over, the Mac Mini started acting really weird with around 50+ logged crash reports in Console, especially with Electron apps. Then Firefox started crashing repeatedly and on came reboot loops with the &ldquo;pink screen of death&rdquo;.</p><p>This was it I thought, I bought a second-hand dud. Something must be wrong hardware-wise. I went ahead with an Apple Diagnostic scan <em>(long press power button to enter recovery mode and then press and hold cmd+D)</em> and lo and behold; there was a memory failure (reference code: PPM001).</p><img src=/2023/sudden-influx-of-new-gear/memfail_m1.webp alt="Mac Mini M1 Diagnostic Scan"><p>I felt silly for not doing this hardware test earlier, before I started setting up all my apps and preferences, troubleshooting through all the weird quirks of Apple Silicon. I brought the Mini straight to the Genius Bar where they said the logic board along with the I/O wall will need to be replaced and will take at least five to seven days.</p><h2 id=cant-retire-yet><div><a href=#cant-retire-yet>#
</a>Can&rsquo;t retire yet</div></h2><p>So today, I am back writing this post on my trusty MacBook Air. My original plan, after getting the Mini all setup, was to replace the battery and SSD on the Air so it could get a new lease of life. I could test out some linux distros on it, maybe try running Docker, or dedicate it for some side project/experimentation&mldr; I think these might have to wait a bit until I get the Mini running smoothly as my daily driver.</p><p>I have already bought a nice set of screwdriver bits containing the the Pentalobe 0.8 and 1.2, thermal paste (Arctic MX-4) and a specific SATA M.2 SSD adapter to do the upgrades soon. I will purchase a replacement battery and a SSD nearer the date of upgrade. I&rsquo;m currently considering these SATA M.2 drives:</p><ul><li>Micron 1300 1TB</li><li>Micron M600 512GB</li><li>Crucial MX500 1TB</li><li>Samsung PM871 512GB</li></ul><p>I will share which SSD I end up choosing and how to the upgrades go. But to check out the new screwdriver, I took off the bottom cover of the MacBook Air and cleaned out <em>11-year-old dust</em>! It runs around 5 to 10 °C lower now compared to before cleaning it. I&rsquo;ll replace the thermal paste when I do the memory / battery upgrade. I can&rsquo;t risk losing my daily driver!</p><p><img src=/2023/sudden-influx-of-new-gear/dust_before.webp alt="11 year old crud">

</a>New Raspberry Pi 5</div></h2><p>Just as I was going to upload this post, I found out the new Pi 5 is coming next month. It is such a bummer that I got mine literally two weeks ago. It is even at the same price but the speed of almost everything is many times faster, not to mention, it has a PCIe slot. Oh well&mldr; I already bought a dual fan attachment, which has arrived earlier this week.</p><img src=/2023/sudden-influx-of-new-gear/rpi_dual_fan.webp alt="Yurobot dual fan attachment with LED for the Raspberry Pi 4B"><p>I decided the distro to install is <a href=https://dietpi.com/>DietPi</a>. Will be seeing if I can boot it from an external SSD (Samsung 870 EVO 512GB SATA SSD) in a USB UGREEN enclosure and start my homelabbing journey!</p></div></article><div class="pagination post-pagination"><div class="left pagination-item"><a href=/2023/booting-dietpi-from-ssd-on-a-raspberry-pi-4b-8gb/>Booting DietPi from SSD on a Raspberry Pi 4B 8GB</a></div><div class="right pagination-item"><a href=/2023/hello-hugo/>Hello, Hugo</a></div></div></main><footer class="common-footer noselect"><div class=common-footer-bottom><div style=display:flex;align-items:center;gap:8px>© 2023-2025 Naty S, BurgeonLab.com.</div><div style=display:flex;align-items:center;gap:4px><div>Powered by <a target=_blank rel="noopener noreferrer" href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>, theme <a target=_blank rel="noopener noreferrer" href=https://github.com/Junyi-99/hugo-theme-anubis2>Anubis2</a>.<br></div></div><p class="h-card vcard"><a href=https://www.burgeonlab.com/ class="p-name u-url url fn" rel=me></a></p></footer></div><a href=#top-anchor><button class=top-anchor><i class="fa fa-angle-double-up" aria-hidden=true></i></button></a></body></html>
